# Assignment 3

## Source Files Submitted:

GenStack.h, Delimeter.h, Delimeter.cpp, FileChecker.h, FileChecker.cpp, main.cpp

## Problems:

Code works fairly well I think. Could not find any bugs. Was glad that we got an extra day to work on this due to current events. I did have some trouble solving a segmentation fault problem but I was able to fix it from scouring the internet.


## Instruction on running program:

g++ **.cpp
./a.out test.txt
